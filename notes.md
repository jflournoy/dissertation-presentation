## Adolescent social reorientation

Hallmarks of adolescent development As adolescence progresses:

- Romantic and sexual interests develop (W. A. Collins et al., 2009)

Rates of dating and sexual behavior increase

- Spend less time with family, more time alone or with peers (Larson & Richards, 1991)

Boys spend less time with family, but replace it with time alone

- Give status more priority (LaFontana & Cillessen, 2010)

More and more adolescents prioritize popularity over other interests, especially rule adherence. Also, romance, companionship friendship Acheivement.

## Two faces of social reorientation

Risk 

- Sexual behavior itself as risk (e.g., CDC, 2018)

Public health research in the US characterizes any adolescent sex as a health risk

- Risk taking as an antecedent & consequence of popularity (e.g., Allen et al., 2005; de Bruyn & Weisfeld, 2017)

Allen and colleagues show longitudinally that increases in popularity lead to increases in minor delinquency and substance use, while de bruyn and weisfeld show that both pro-social and dominant popular adolescents have higer incidence of substance use etc.

Benefit

Mate seeking and status concerns from the view of evolutionary psychology are fundamental motives evolved in response to fitness challenges.

- Fundamental motives evolved in response to fitness challenges (Ellis et al., 2012; Schaller et al., 2017)

- Mate-seeking (W. A. Collins et al, 2009; Harden & Mendle, 2011)

Well-being may be enhanced by satisfaction of these motives, as well.

Andrew Collins and colleagues review literature showing associations between romantic relationships and relationship quality and self-worth.

Harden and Mendle show that controlling for genetic confounds, sexual activity in the context of romantic relationships is associated with less delinquency

- Status (Allen et al., 2005; Shi & Moody, 2017)

Allen and colleagues show that despite the increase in risk behaviors, popularity is associated with future decreases in hostile behavior. 

Shi and Moody show that adolescent social status longitudinally predicts adult income over and above a host of related confounds

## Mechanisms of social reorientation

What mechanisms might be responsible for this shift?

Nelson and colleagues propose

- Developmental changes in perceptual, motivational, and executive control brain regions (Nelson et al., 2016).
- May highlight developmentally-relevant opportunities in the environment
    - Direct effects on cue salience
    - Learned associations that shift due to reward value shifts

## Measuring social motives in the lab

- Goal: create behavioral task using learning to measure social motives.
- Reinforcement learning & attention
    - Cue salience influenced by past predictive value (Kruschke, 2011; Mackintosh, 1975)
    - _A priori_ salience affects learning
- Information relevant to social motivations should be learned more quickly

Attentional theories of learning hold that cue salience is influenced by the past predictive value of that cue.
In other words, if some information in the environment is relevant to an particular motivation, an individual high in that motivation will attend more strongly to that information.
The increased salience of that information for that person means that they should learn more quickly about that information in the future.

For example, if a particular adolescent was interested in finding new romantic or sexual partners, they've probably learned to that it's important to know about whether their peers are in a relationship or not, and so they would be expected to learn more quickly about the relationship status of other people.
Similarly for someone motivated to gain status, knowing the social standing of others is likely to be important, and learned more quickly.

## Iterative instrumental learning model

The probability of pressing the right button on any trial, faced with any particular face and word pair, starts off at 50%.

The model assumes that this probability is determined by an action weight for each cue, which is a function of a number of things.

First, some people might just want to press the right arrow key more or less than other people (it's a sort of default choice). In this model, this is the right bias parameter. It's not of substantive interest, but it helps the model fit better.

Second, some people might be able to pay more attention than others, or be less in a hurry. There are a lot of things that could lead to random responding. To capture this, the model has a noise parameter. When this parameter is very large, people choose randomly. When it's very small, their behavior is governed strongly by the instrumental learning parameters.

The first of these parameters, rho, affects the relative size of the rewards received on each trial. The more someone is influenced by reward feedback, the bigger this parameter will be.

Finally, the core of the learning model is the learning rate parameter, epsilon, which determines how much each trial updates your action weight. In other words, on each trial, if you're surprised by the feedback you get, you'll update what you do the next time you see the same face-word pair. This parameter determines how much each trial matters to you for updating your behavior.

While b and xi have a pretty clear expected effect on overall performance (if their large, performance will suffer)
rho and epsilon do not, at least when feedback is probabilistic.

If you always got rewarded for the best choice, being very sensitive to rewards, and updating your action weight very quickly would be best.
But if you sometimes get rewards for choices that are not optimal, you may be misled if you're too sensitive to feedback.

For that reason, at least according to the model, there's a sweet-spot for both of these paramters where you'll perform best overall if they're large, but not too large.
