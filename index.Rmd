## Background: Adolescence is a preiod of social reorientation

- Romantic and sexual interests develop (W. A. Collins et al., 2009)
- Spend less time with family, more time alone or with peers (Larson & Richards, 1991)
- Give status more priority (LaFontana & Cillessen, 2010)

## Two faces of social reorientation: risk

- Sexual behavior during adolescence itself as health risk 
    - Youth Risk Behavior Survey considers ever having had sex as a risk-factor to be reduced (CDC, 2018)
- Romantic relationships can be a source of emotional distress (W. A. Collins et al, 2009)
- Minor delinquency, substance use may be an antecedent & consequence of popularity (Allen et al., 2005; de Bruyn & Weisfeld, 2017)

## Two faces of social reorientation: Benefit

- Evolutionary psychology perspective 
    - Development of motivations evolved in response to fitness challenges (Ellis et al., 2012; Schaller et al., 2017)
    - Finding mates, and gaining status
- Satisfaction of these motives might support well-being
    - Being in a relationship associated with higher self-worth  (W. A. Collins et al, 2009)
    - Controlling for genetic confounds, sexual activity in romantic relationships is related to less delinquency (Harden & Mendle, 2011)
    - Popularity also prospectively associated with decreases in overt hostility (Allen et al., 2005)
    - Adolescent social status associated with adult income (Shi & Moody, 2017)

## Mechanisms of social reorientation

- Neurodevelopmental changes in perceptual, motivational, and executive control brain regions change the way you experience the environment (Nelson et al., 2016)
- May highlight developmentally-relevant opportunities in the environment
    - Directly altering stimulus salience
    - Shifting associations via changes in what someone finds rewarding

## Goal: Measuring social motives in the lab

- Create behavioral task using the effect of salience on learning
- Attentional theories of learning posit that 
    - Salience of a stimulus affects learning
    - Past predictive value of a stimulus can alter its salience (Kruschke, 2011; Mackintosh, 1975)
- Information relevant to social motivations should be more salient and so should be learned more quickly
- As an individual develops through adolescence, this should become more pronounced.

## The Social Probabilistic Learning Task (SPLT)

<img src="figures/trial_example.png" style="width:50%;float:right" />

- People learn an association between each of 6 faces and one of 2 words
- **Hungry/Thirsty**  
  **Dating/Looking**  
  **Popular/Unpopular**
- Each trial
    - presented with a face with 2 potential descriptors
    - press $\leftarrow$ or $\rightarrow$ keys to select which descriptor matches that face
    - receive feedback of 0, 1, 5 points
    - The first time is a wild guess, but people learn over time
    - 20% of the time, people get misleading feedback
- 8 blocks x 8 trials x 6 faces = 384 trials

## Aims

1. Does this "motivational framing" enhance learning?
    - Will people learn the social descriptors better?
2. Does motive-related learning enhancement covary with development as we would expect?
    - Will this effect be stronger in older participants?
3. Does learning enhancement relate to self-report motives?
    - Will this effect be stronger for those that report stronger social motives?

## 334 Participants

Adolescents drawn from ongoing longitudinal study (TDS)  
College students from SONA

| Sample                  |    N|     *Male* |*Female*|   Age *Male* |   *Female* |
|-------------------------|----:|-----------:|-------:|-------------:|-----------:|
| Community adolescents   |   65|         29 |     36 |   15.5 (1.5) | 15.6 (1.7) |
| Foster-care adolescents |   39|         19 |     20 |   15.6 (1.5) | 17.0 (1.7) |
| College Students        |   85|         33 |     52 |   20.9 (4.2) | 19.3 (1.3) |
| College Students Online |  141|         37 |    104 |   19.8 (1.4) | 19.3 (1.2) |

- $N=13$ foster-care adolescents don't have task data
- 313 participants provided task data (334 - 21 missing)

## Participants Pubertal Development

## Approaches to describing task behavior

1. Use raw behavior directly: Average number of optimal decisions during last 1/2 of the run.
    - H1: More optimal decisions in motive-conditions
    - H2: Size of difference will be bigger in more developed participants 
    - H3: Size of difference will +correlate with self-report motives
2. Bayesian modeling: Rescorla-Wagner instrumental learning model
    - Examine model parameter differences between conditions
    - Explore individual differences

## Aim 1: Does motive-framing enhance learning?

Raw behavior

<img src="figures/trialaverages-1.svg" style="width:70%;float:left" />

**D/L**  
t(185) = 2.69,  
D = .029  
p = .008 

**P/U**  
t(185) = 4.54,  
D = .047  
p = .00001

## How the reinforcement learning model works

- Describes the probability of pressing $\rightarrow$ on each trial
- This probability is determined by an action weight
- Action weight is a function of 4 parameters: 
    1. Right-bias $b$ - Some people might just be prone to (not) pressing $\rightarrow$
    2. "Noise" $\xi$ - Random responding (attention, hurrying, lower ability)
    3. Reward-value $\rho$ - Determines how rewarding the points are
    4. Learning-rate $\epsilon$ - Determines the how influential any given trial is 
- Bayesian analysis to estimate the model and interpret parameter posterior densities

## Aim 1 Summary: Motive effects on learning

<div style="margin: auto;width: 80%;text-align: left; border:1px solid grey;">
1. Overall better learning in motive conditions
2. Possibly due to higher learning rate, lower noise
</div>

## Aim 2: Correlations with development

Does motive-related learning enhancement covary with development as we would expect?

Indices of development:

- Age
- Pubertal Development Scale (Petersen et al., 1988)

## Optimal choice performance and age

## Optimal choice performance and puberty

<img src="figures/all_figures/poptpdsplot-1.svg" style="width:90%" />

## Model parameters and age

<img src="figures/all_figures/ageparplots-1.svg" style="width:85%" />

## Model parameters and puberty

<img src="figures/all_figures/pubertyparplots-1.svg" style="width:85%" />

## Aim 2 Summary: Motive effects and development

<div style="margin: auto;width: 80%;text-align: left; border:1px solid grey;">
1. More developed participants perform better in general...
2. ...likely due to less random responding ($\xi$).
3. Motive related learning enhancement does not appear to covary with development as we would expect.
    - Older particpants do not appear to learn better in social motive conditions.
</div>

## Aim 3: Correlations with self-report motives

Does learning enhancement relate to self-report motives?

Measures related to social motives (College samples only)

- Fundamental Social Motives Inventory (FSMI; Neel et al., 2015)
- Dominance & Prestige Strategies (D&P; Cheng et al., 2013)

Measures related to social motives (All samples)

- Kids' Social Reward Questionnaire (K-SRQ; Foulkes et al., 2014)
- Urgency and Sensation-Seeking (UPPS-P; Whiteside et al., 2005)

*nb: all analyses done using latent variable measurement models*

## College samples

## All samples

## Aim 3 Summary: Motive effects and self-report motives

<div style="margin: auto;width: 80%;text-align: left; border:1px solid grey;">
1. No significant correlations with convergent measures
2. Absolute magnitude of all corraltions < .2 (many significantly)
3. Learning enhancement does not relate to self-report motives
</div>

## General conclusions

1. Learning is affected by "motive" framing
2. Individual differences don't behave as expected
    - One possibility: these motives _don't_ develop during adolescence  
    AND  
    Self-report measures _don't_ measure motives
    - Another possibility: the task effect is not the result of motives, per se
        - Descriptors vary along many possible dimensions
    - One more: individual differences in the task are badly measured
3. We did learn something about reinforcement learning

## These results in context

1. Generally, adults, or young adults, perform better than adolescents or children<sup>1</sup> 
    - This study is the largest cross-sectional, and second to @peters2017 longitudinal
2. Some author propose that purported heightened reward sensitivity during adolescence may enhance learning.
    - Scant evidence in the literature (Davidow et al., 2016)
    - No evidence of adolescent-specific benefit
    - No evidence of adolescent-reward sensitivity (e.g., $rho$)
3. Very little work on instrumental learning of social information in adolescence.

## Future directions

- Account for working memory in learning task (A. G. E. Collins et al., 2017)
- Expand lexical space
- Other behavioral paradigms may provide more fine-grained information
    - Continuous-value economic games 
    - "Information exploration" games
- Focus on means
