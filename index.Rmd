## The importance of adolescence

- Transition from quiescent childhood to adulthood
- Avoidable health-risks increase

## Lenses for understading adolescence

- "Imbalanced" brain-system development (Casey et al., 2016; Shulman et al., 2016)
- Need for exploration (Romer et al., 2017)
- Social reorientation toward peers (Nelson et al., 2016)
- Can we get more specific about functional relevance of behavior?

## Status and Mate-seeking

- Sexual activity as a risk-factor
- Popularity: antecedents and consequences
- Status and Mate-seeking as developmentally appropriate goals
- Motives encourage behaviors that satisfice them
- How much of adolescent decision making is in service of these motives?
- To know we need to measure them.

## Measuring social motives in the lab

- What might be influenced by differences in motivations?
- Attentional learning: cue salience influenced by past predictive value (Kruschke, 2011; Mackintosh, 1975)
- Information relevant to social motivations should be learned more quickly

## The Social Probabilistic Learning Task (SPLT)

<img src="figures/trial_example.png" style="width:50%;float:right" />

- Association between each of 6 faces with one of 2 words
- **Hungry/Thirsty**  
  **Dating/Looking**  
  **Popular/Unpopular**
- Each trial  
  press $\leftarrow$ or $\rightarrow$  
  receive feedback
- Probabilisitic: Best answer rewarded 80%
- 8 blocks x 8 trials x 6 faces = 384 trials

## Aims

1. Does this "motivational framing" enhance learning?
2. Does motive-related learning enhancement covary with development as we would expect?
3. Does learning enhancement relate to self-report motives?

- 313 participants provided task data (334 - 21 missing)
- 33% (N=13) were from the foster-care adolescent sample
